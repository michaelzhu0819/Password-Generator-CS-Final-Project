# Password-Generator-CS-Final-Project
This is a program that allows you to generate passwords with
great amounts of flexibility. You have by default four security
levels to choose from, with each one being a little different
from one another. If you are not satisfied you can use the
advanced generator after using the normal one once to
customize your password even greater. After you are done
you can either generate more, quit or save the pws to your
computer.

the instructions of how to use the code is displayed when running
the code.

This program has way greater adaptibility and flexibility when generating
passcodes, it also has a save function which allows you to actually
remember it when it's saved as a file on your computer.

The target audience is for people like me who doesn't want to spend
time creating a passcode but at the same time everyone around them
knows their passwords and could easily sabatoge their entire life
by trolling on their accounts if the people want to.
